<h1>Time Series Forecast on CO2 Concentration</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Climate change has always been a significant threat to humanity, and each time global warm- ing intensifies, it cannot be ignored. The main reason of global warming is the concentration of CO2. In this article, you will realize the rapid acceleration of CO2 concentration over time. We will present the CO2 concentration data from 1960 to 2021 collected by Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, with the emphasis on the seasonal change of co2 concentration level from 2015 to 2021. Additionally, the time series forecast presented in this article indicates that the CO2 concentration will continue to rise in a seasonal trend. Arima method is being used to find models and estimations.We also build up the 95% prediction interval and the 95% confidence interval to help us analyze the data. We conclude that human development activities are the main cause of the dramatic seasonal increase in carbon emissions. Since the industrial revolution, human-caused carbon dioxide emissions have grown year after year, and the greenhouse effect of the atmosphere has intensified, triggering climate change and posing a series of serious challenges.
